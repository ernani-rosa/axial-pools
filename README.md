# Script to get all swaps from Axial Exchange pools

This python script uses the snowtrace.io API to get all the swaps from the Axial decentralized exchange on the Avalanche network.

The `main` function has some code to save it as .csv files for later exploration and visualization.

A simple dashboard using the data from one of the pools can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ernani.guimar.es.rosa/viz/Teste1_16577547994580/Dashboard1?publish=yes
